Resources I used:

I followed along with the youtube channel KidsCanCode's Platformer playlist. He made a vertical platformer game
where he jumps up and tries to get a high score. With his tutorial i made a side scrolling platformer where the player
can shoot towards the mouse cursor at enemies that spawn. the game progressively gets harder the more kills the player gets.
